== Warning: Do not use. 
== This is an experiment to see how far I can get using AI.

Almost everything here was written by AI.

Prompt Used:

1. Let‚Äôs create a ruby gem using Gemsmith https://alchemists.io/projects/gemsmith
2. We‚Äôre working on creating a ruby gem that will provide an API for the PDFium library.
3. This gem should allow the user to set the path to the PDFium binary in an ENV variable.
4. Use ruby-ffi, https://github.com/ffi/ffi, to call functions in the PDFium library.
5. Start by adding an interface for: https://developers.foxit.com/resources/pdf-sdk/c_api_reference_pdfium/group___f_f_d_f_d_o_c_u_m_e_n_t.html
    1. For example, we want it to be architected in such a way that we can call ‚ÄúPdfium.new(‚Äòfile path to pdf‚Äô).dimensions‚Äù in our ruby code and it returns the [width,height] of the document. 
    2. Another example would be ‚ÄúPdfium.new(‚Äòfile path to pdf‚Äô).annotations‚Äù would return all of the annotations in a PDF. 
    3. Another example would be ‚ÄúPdfium.new(‚Äòfile path to pdf‚Äô).annotations_by_page(1)‚Äù would return annotations for the first page.
6. Each module, https://developers.foxit.com/resources/pdf-sdk/c_api_reference_pdfium/modules.html from the documentation should have its own file. Keep them colocated in the lib/PDFium folder
7. Write a corresponding RSpec spec for each module of the API https://developers.foxit.com/resources/pdf-sdk/c_api_reference_pdfium/index.html. start by writing the tests first for each module. The tests should pass before moving on. The folder structure of the tests should match the lib folder.

1. Let‚Äôs try to match all of the features documented in the api, https://developers.foxit.com/resources/pdf-sdk/c_api_reference_pdfium/index.html.

toc::[]

== Features

* Ruby bindings for the PDFium library
* Access PDF document properties (dimensions, page count)
* Get annotations from PDF documents
* Set custom PDFium library path via environment variable

== Requirements

. link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby].
. PDFium library (libpdfium.dylib, libpdfium.so, or pdfium.dll)

== Setup

To install _with_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
# üí° Skip this line if you already have the public certificate installed.
gem cert --add <(curl --compressed --location https://undefined.io/gems.pem)
gem install rb-pdfium --trust-policy HighSecurity
----

To install _without_ security, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install rb-pdfium
----

You can also add the gem directly to your project:

[source,bash]
----
bundle add rb-pdfium
----

Once the gem is installed, you only need to require it:

[source,ruby]
----
require "pdfium"
----

== Usage

=== Setting PDFium Library Path

By default, the gem will look for the PDFium library in the system's standard library paths. You can specify a custom path using the `PDFIUM_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable:

[source,bash]
----
export PDFIUM_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libpdfium.dylib
----

Or in your Ruby code:

[source,ruby]
----
ENV["PDFIUM_LIBRARY_PATH"] = "/path/to/libpdfium.dylib"
----

=== Opening a PDF Document

[source,ruby]
----
# Open a PDF document
pdf = Pdfium.new("path/to/document.pdf")

# Open a password-protected PDF document
pdf = Pdfium.new("path/to/document.pdf", "password")
----

=== Getting Document Information

[source,ruby]
----
# Get document dimensions (width and height of the first page)
width, height = pdf.dimensions
puts "Document dimensions: #{width} x #{height} points"

# Get page count
page_count = pdf.page_count
puts "Number of pages: #{page_count}"

# Get dimensions of a specific page (0-based index)
width, height = pdf.dimensions_for_page(1)  # Second page
puts "Page 2 dimensions: #{width} x #{height} points"
----

=== Working with Annotations

[source,ruby]
----
# Get all annotations in the document
annotations = pdf.annotations
puts "Total annotations: #{annotations.size}"

# Get annotations for a specific page (0-based index)
page_annotations = pdf.annotations_by_page(0)  # First page
puts "Annotations on page 1: #{page_annotations.size}"

# Process annotations
page_annotations.each do |annotation|
  puts "Annotation type: #{annotation[:subtype]}"
  puts "Position: #{annotation[:rect]}"
  puts "Contents: #{annotation[:contents]}"
  puts "---"
end
----

=== Closing the Document

The document will be automatically closed when the object is garbage collected, but you can explicitly close it:

[source,ruby]
----
pdf.close
----

== Development

To contribute, run:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/undefined/rb-pdfium
cd rb-pdfium
bin/setup
----

You can also use the IRB console for direct access to all objects:

[source,bash]
----
bin/console
----

== Tests

To test, run:

[source,bash]
----
bin/rake
----
